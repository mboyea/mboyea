# 😀 Hi, I'm Matthew!

I've been programming since 2018. I do full-stack website development, videogame development, and robotics programming.

- Working on software is just about my favorite thing to do.
- I also really enjoy **weightlifting** 🏋️ & **kickboxing** 🥊 and I *love* to work on **cars** 🚘!!

## 🔭 Current Work

- ~~**LanCouch** is a VPN service targeted towards gamers who miss playing games like Diablo II that only support LAN multiplayer.
  See the prototype in-progress at [github.com/mboyea/fly-vpn](https://github.com/mboyea/fly-vpn).~~
- ~~**Lacuna** is my master template for making websites.
  See the project in-progress at [github.com/mboyea/lacuna](https://github.com/mboyea/lacuna).~~
- **[www.mboyea.com](https://www.mboyea.com)** is my portfolio website.
  See the source code at [github.com/mboyea/www-mboyea-com](https://github.com/mboyea/www-mboyea-com).
- **Jotrift** is the name of my upcoming Markdown note storage software.
  My feature list for the MVP prototype is:
  - Files (Notes + Images) organized in a directory hierarchy
  - Notes stored in Pandoc-Flavored Markdown (.md) with YAML metadata headers in a SQL database
  - Images compressed to 5MB and stored in AWS S3 (image metadata and location will be linked to by the Postgres DB)
  - Users can securely login to their account to access their notes
  - Users can export (download) thier documents & images
  - Users can perform full text search over their notes (like Simplenote)
  This is a closed-source project!
