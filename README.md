# 😀 Hi, I'm Matthew!

I do full-stack website development, videogame development, and robotics programming.

- Working on software is just about my favorite thing to do.
- I also really enjoy **weightlifting** 🏋️ and **kickboxing** 🥊 and I *love* to work on **cars** 🚘!!
- I was born in 2004. I built my first computer in 2014. I started making software in 2017. I've been programming for work since 2019. I graduated with a Comp. Sci. degree in 2023.

## 🔭 Current Work

- **[www.mboyea.com](https://www.mboyea.com)** is my portfolio website, made with PostgreSQL and SvelteKit.
  
  See the source code at [github.com/mboyea/www-mboyea-com](https://github.com/mboyea/www-mboyea-com).
- **MDC (Markdown Converter)** is a piece of software I use to convert my Markdown notes into PDF documents.
  
  See the source code at [github.com/mboyea/mdc](https://github.com/mboyea/mdc)
- **Jotrift** is the name of my upcoming Markdown note storage software.
  My feature list for the MVP prototype is:
  
  - Files (Notes + Images) organized in a directory hierarchy
  - Notes stored in Pandoc-Flavored Markdown (.md) with YAML metadata headers in a SQL database
  - Images compressed to 5MB and stored in AWS S3 (image metadata and location will be linked to by the Postgres DB)
  - Users can securely login to their account to access their notes
  - Users can export (download) thier documents & images
  - Users can perform full text search over their notes (like Simplenote)
  
  This project is closed-source. 
- **Sometimes I take contracts** to build websites for small businesses.
  I don't advertise this because it's not very profitable.
  These projects are often closed source.
