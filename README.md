# 😀 Hi, I'm Matthew!

I've been programming since 2018. I do full-stack website development, videogame development, and robotics programming.

- Working on software is just about my favorite thing to do.
- I also really enjoy **weightlifting** 🏋️ & **kickboxing** 🥊 and I *love* to work on **cars** 🚘!!

## 🔭 Current Work

- **LanCouch** is a VPN service targeted towards gamers who miss playing games like Diablo II that only support LAN multiplayer. See the prototype in-progress at [github.com/mboyea/fly-vpn](https://github.com/mboyea/fly-vpn).
- **Lacuna** is my master template for making websites. See the project in-progress at [github.com/mboyea/lacuna](https://github.com/mboyea/lacuna).
