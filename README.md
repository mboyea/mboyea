### Hey, I'm Matthew Boyea.
#### An Engineer, Athlete, & Scholar.
My right to having more than enough is cancelled if I don't use that more to help those who have less.
We strive and die for what will be here when we're gone.
I remain, obediently yours.

I study philosophies, systems, and experiences. I share what I can in articles at [mboyea.com/articles](https://www.mboyea.com/articles) and in videos at [youtube.com/@mtcboyea](https://www.youtube.com/@mtcboyea).

#### I specialize in software technology.
I do full-stack website development, embedded systems programming, & videogame development.

For a comprehensive list of my skills, check out my porfolio and resume at [mboyea.com/portfolio](https://www.mboyea.com/portfolio).
