### Hey, I'm Matthew Boyea.
I create software to improve the reach of products for education, commerce, and media.

#### Engineer. Athlete. Scholar.
My childhood was full of challenges, but also full of opportunities. In overcoming each challenge, I developed new skills and understanding. In seizing each opportunity, I brought myself closer to a great life. Through that process, I have learned a great deal which I would like to share with others over the course of my life.

I seek to provide value for my communities, my family, and my self.
In that effort, I study all manner of philosophies, systems, and experiences.
I share what I can in articles at [mboyea.com/articles](https://www.mboyea.com/articles) and in videos at [youtube.com/@mtcboyea](https://www.youtube.com/@mtcboyea)

#### I'm a software technology expert.
I do full-stack website development, desktop application development, integrated systems programming, industrial manufacturing robot programming, videogame development, and database development.

For a comprehensive list of all my skills, check out my porfolio and resume at [https://www.mboyea.com/portfolio](https://www.mboyea.com/portfolio).
